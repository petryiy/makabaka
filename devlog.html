                This website I spent like almost a month to build and tbh this is my first time to build a website.
                Believe it or not, before it I don't even know how to build a website. but you know, I'm such a genius,
                so i'd never say can't. Therefore, during this amount of time, i tried to learn how to build a website, 
                stumbled through countless bugs, late night frustration, and errors. Finally here we are, we got this perfect (obviously not perect) creation.

                <h2>Initial Idea</h2>
                <p>Intially i was thinking about what should i get for my gf's birthday. But I feel like all the things
                    I come up with are so normal and boring. I wanna get something truly special and meaningful. So i was 
                    thinking of giving her a memory. It was around 19 June, while her birthday is at 15 July. I only got 
                    about a month to learn how to build a website and finish it. tough work
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>First page</h3>
                <p>
                    The first page will be a welcome page and gonna say hbd to her on that page. Nothing complex. But back then,
                    I know nothing about a website. I didn't even know how html and css work. The font size were all over the place,
                    the buttons never responded, and nothing aligned right.
                </p>

                <h4>Memory page</h4>
                <p>
                    This page my idea was make it feel like a theatre and playing all the memorable scenes with word descriptions on it.
                    The hardest part is how to make that work. And here i had my first js file for it. Using loops to create cards and 
                    settimeout to control when they appeared. This part took me abt 5 days. It's really hard to organise the layout. 
                    But once it worked, I felt a great sense of accomplishment. By the end, i also added a transition animation for this page.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h5>Future page</h5>
                <p>
                    This page, I would say it's the hardest page. Orignially, my idea was to copy the memory page, presenting each cards 
                    and then do an animation of putting those cards to each wish bottle. Then i realise that only exists in my imagination.
                    That was way too hard for me. So I changed it to showing the wish bottles and they will present the card after user click them.
                    When building this page, i realised that i shouldn't put all the style in one css file, and should have my css folder and 
                    js folder. For the background, i used some Maths stuff to manually created those stars. I quite like it. In my css, I made 
                    the bottle glow. and I made the button float. But ofc lots of issues have been faced: bottles at wrong place covered the word and button
                    so i made them fixed. title and body squeezed, so i adjusted the css......

            <section>
                <h6>Present page</h6>
                <p>
                    This page is the emotional climax of the whole script although it's not hard to build. After the memories of the past and 
                    the dreams for the future, everything is pulled back to this moment - the reality. And in this reality, I'm right downstairs,
                    waiting for her. What a genius script. As i mentioned, initially i was just going to do the memory page. But after i finished
                    that page, i thought since i already have the memory page, there's no reason i don't build future and present. Also started to
                    enjoy building this website at that moment.

            <section>
                <h7>Home page</h7>
                <p>
                    On this page, I realised that i need footer and a home bar. It was only 7 days left till her birthday, and i still got lots
                    of stuff to do üò©. I made a timer for this page, umm i love Math.

            <section>
                <h8>Album page</h8>
                <p>
                    This is an annoying page. At first, i added the photos to the folder, but none of them would should up. So I re-exported
                    all of them and save them to png file. it works, but then why all the photos lined up on the left  instead of three each line üò≠.
                    I spent hours fixing that. Then the images size are so weired. ok i fixed it. Now another new issue, how can i close the image
                    after i click it... why it doesn't work.... ok i give up, just use the browser back button. I don't have time to fix it.
                    I might leave it to the future. 
                    Thanks Gua for fixing this page for me, he is such a genius.

            <section>
                <h9>DevLog page</h9>
                <p>
                    Now it's this page, I finally make it to this stage. Can't imagine how I made it this far. it's 12 Jul,
                    only 2 days left. I need to finish it on 14 Jul so that i can send it to her on that night. But I still got a lot to do. I haven't 
                    drawn the pictures for wish bottles on future page yet. and I also need to adjust some timing stuff for memory page. Also need to
                    add the footer for rest of the pages. I'm tired but pround of myself, the journey of from knowing nothing to building a complete website.
                    She was asking me what i was working on these days, and i said - something important üòé.
